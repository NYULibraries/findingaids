    <h4>When searching, it is helpful to keep a few things in mind:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Try many different terms. ' "NYU clubs" ' will produce different
        results than ' "NYU society" ' or ' "New York University clubs" '
      </li>
      <li>
        The more words you use in your search, the more results will
        come back to you. 'Abraham Lincoln Brigade' will produce more
        results than 'Lincoln' but not all results for 'Lincoln' will be
        about the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. You can search for specific
        phrases by using double quotation marks " ".
      </li>
      <li>
        You may narrow down your results by using the search filters on
        the left of the screen. Not all materials may be located via this
        method and relevant results may be excluded.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are looking for a particular item or materials on a
        particular subject, there may be material about that subject in
        several archives.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Advanced tips:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can create advanced searches to limit, broaden or define your
        search using Boolean operators (e.g. AND, OR, NOT).
      </li>
      <li>
        You can adjust the granularity of results by using the 'Format'
        facet. For example you can view results for entire archives,
        series, folders, or items.
