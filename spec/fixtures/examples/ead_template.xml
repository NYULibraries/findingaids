      <appraisal>
        <p>The records of the Mid-Ocean Dynamics Experiment came to the Institute
        Archives in two accessions in 1980 and 1982. During processing the collection was reduced
        from fifteen cubic feet to four by discarding duplicate materials, financial records, and
        publications not authored by MODE participants. Forty charts and six inches of raw data
        presented the primary appraisal issues. The raw data consisted of bulletins and reports
        referring to float positions, moorings, isotherms, geostrophic velocity calculations,
        ships' summaries, and work proposed and work carried out during the MODE-I experiment.
        As this raw data was recapitulated in weekly <title render="underline">MODE Hot
        Line Bulletins</title>, only a sampling was retained in the collection. Also discarded
        were ten charts for which there were no descriptions of indicated data points, nor were
        dates or test site locations provided.</p>
        <p>Six inches of materials pertaining to the POLYMODE project, 1973-1980, were added
        to the Institute Archives POLYMODE collection.</p>
        <p>The appraisal of this collection was carried out in consultation with Robert
        Heinmiller, a research associate at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution during MODE.</p>
