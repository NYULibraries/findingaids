            <p>This finding aid is the result of the New York University Bobst Library's Digital Pilot Project, a case study in special collections digitization, undertaken as a collaboration between the University Archives, The Barbara Goldsmith Preservation and Conservation Department, and Digital Library Technical Services, with the support of the developers of The Archivists' Toolkit. The goals of the project were to create a Washington Square Image website for the UA that integrated high quality digital images into an item-level EAD finding aid; to train the UA staff in preservation scanning and metadata creation, and to create guides for these processes that can be used for future projects.</p>
            <p>Primary project support was provided by David O'Neill, Melitte Buchman, Brian Hoffman, Nancy Cricco and Paula DeStefano. Scanning and metadata creation for the Digital Pilot Project by David O'Neill, Peter Asch, Janet Bunde, Lisa Darms, Steven D'Avria, Annie Grunow, William McKeldin, Alex Starace and Laura Zeccardi.</p>

            <p>The photographs in the Washington Square Park and Washington Square Image Collection represent two series of the University Archives' larger Photography Collection. The Photography Collection consists of photographs that were separated from university administrative collections or received as part of regular accessions from the University Photo Bureau. The Photo Bureau was founded in 1952, and archived their own collections until the mid-1980s, when they began regularly transferring prints, contact sheets and negatives to the University archives. All prints received from the Photo Bureau and those separated from administrative collections were incoporated into existing subject-based series. The Washington Square Park and Washington Square Area series represent the subject categories selected by the University Archives for digitization in the Spring of 2008.</p>

            <p>This collection contains images of Washington Square Park (New York, N.Y.), the Washington Square area (below 14th Street, above Houston St.) and the old University Building (1832-1894) from the New York University Archives photography collection. Almost all of the images are black and white gelatin silver prints, although a few are Polaroid photographs, color c-prints, or drawings. A number of the photographs are prints made from copy-negatives of original photographs, drawings or art prints. Many of the photographs were created by the New York University's Photo Bureau to document the University's geography and cultural life, and they provide evidence of the history of the Park and the surrounding area from the early 1800s through the 1990s. Series I and II include thumbnails that link to larger images. Series III is a recent addition. Images for Series III will be included in early 2012.</p>

            <p>The bulk of this collection contains photographic and print images of Washington Square Park and the surrounding area. Buildings that are part of New York University's Washington Square campus, extant as well as demolished are included in this collection.</p>
            <p>There is a separate series for the the University Building, New York University's first permanent home. It was constructed on the northeast corner of the park between Washington Place and Waverly Place in 1833-34. Architects Ithiel Town, Alexander Jackson Davis, and James Dakin as well as NYU engineering professor David B. Douglass designed the universityâ€™s first building in the Gothic Revival-style. This type of architectural style was meant to evoke the medieval buildings of Oxford and Cambridge and link the more modern and practical American curriculum the university was founded on to the long, rich tradition of English education.</p>
            <p>Initially, the building was too large for the student body to fill so residential rooms, studios, and laboratories were rented out to a variety of artists and inventors including Winslow Homer and Samuel F.B. Morse. In the late 19th century as the university expanded, the undergraduate college moved to the more spacious University Heights campus in the Bronx initially leading to the decline of the Washington Square campus and in 1894 the University Building was demolished. It was replaced by Main Building (now the Silver Center).</p>
