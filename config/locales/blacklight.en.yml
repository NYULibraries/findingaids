          When searching, it’s good to keep a few things in mind: Try lots
          of different terms. ‘ “NYU clubs”’ will produce different
          results than ‘ “NYU society” ‘ or ‘ “New York University clubs”
          ‘ The more words you use in your search, the more results will
          come back to you. ‘Abraham Lincoln Brigade’ will produce more
          results than ‘Lincoln’ but not all results for ‘Lincoln’ will be
          about the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. You can search for specific
          phrases by using double quotation marks “ “.  You can narrow
          down your results to categories of content by using the facets
          on the left of the screen.  Results in the facets, particularly
          “Name,” “Material Type,” “Place,” and “Subject” can be thought
          of as tags — if an item has been tagged with any of the terms in
          the list, it will appear in the revised results. But some
          relevant results may not have been tagged — narrowing this way
          may result in missing good material!  Advanced tips: Archival
          collections are organized by who collected the materials,
          e.g. The Newspaper Guild of New York or Richard Courant. If you
          are looking for a particular item or materials on a particular
          subject, there may be material about that subject in several
          collections. In other words, you may be pleasantly surprised by
          searching outside of the collections that you think an item
          should be in.  Search supports all capitals Boolean operators
          (AND, OR, NOT).  The default search returns both records for
          whole collections as well as more detailed descriptions from
          within their inventories. To adjust the granularity of results,
          use the ‘Format’ facet.
